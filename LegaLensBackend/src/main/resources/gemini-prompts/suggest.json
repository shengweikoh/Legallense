Examples:\n• Example 1: \"Consider requesting a shorter probationary period (e.g., from 6 months to 3 months) or including clear performance criteria to end probation earlier upon successful completion.\"\n• Example 2: \"You may want to clarify the scope of the non-compete clause to ensure it is reasonable in duration and geographical area, preventing undue restrictions on your future employment opportunities.\"\n2. Context:\nYou are reviewing an employment contract for your client, identifying areas where clauses can be improved to better protect their interests or reduce potential risks.\nUse the following information below on Singapore employment terms as reference.\nThe company name should be indicated in full as per the registered name with ACRA, e.g., in the case of an employer who is an individual, the full name as specified in the NRIC/passport or trade name should be used (e.g., Shop name is used as “Lucky Provision Shop” instead of “Lucky Provisions Pte. Ltd.”). The employee’s full name should be as per the name on their identity card, work pass, or passport, and short names are often used in contracts (e.g., “Alvin Tan” or “Ah Seng”). The job title should be stated simply as the employee’s job title without mentioning the job scope, e.g., only “Sales Assistant” without additional details. The main duties and responsibilities should describe the employee’s key responsibilities. The employment start date should reflect the employee’s first day of work, but may sometimes only be indicated as the “Agreement Date” or “Issuance Date of contract”. The employment end date should reflect the employee’s end date of employment, applicable only to fixed-term contracts. The place of work should indicate the company’s address if the employee is deployed at a different work location, and employers are encouraged to include this information. Daily working hours should reflect the employee’s start and end times on workdays, along with break hours (e.g., 9am to 6pm with a 1-hour lunch break), though some documents do not include break hours. The number of working days per week should be specified (e.g., “5 days a week” from Monday to Friday), and the rest day should be specified (e.g., “Saturday”). Employees are entitled to at least one rest day per week, though this is not always clearly stated. Pay should include the basic rate of pay, which covers wage adjustments and increments that the employee is entitled to, excluding overtime, bonuses, and annual wage supplements (AWS), along with any reimbursements for special expenses incurred during employment, productivity incentive payments, or allowances. The gross rate of pay should reflect the total amount of money, including allowances, payable for one month’s work, excluding overtime, bonus, AWS, reimbursements, productivity incentives, and allowances for travel, food, and housing. Overtime pay should be at 1.5 times the hourly basic rate for extra hours worked beyond 8 hours a day or 44 hours per week. Fixed allowances and deductions should be indicated without a breakdown of the items. Leave entitlements should include annual leave, sick leave, hospitalization leave, and other leave types if applicable. Employees are entitled to 7 days of paid annual leave in the first year, with one additional day per year for each subsequent year worked, and after 8 years of service, employees are entitled to 14 days. Employees who have worked for at least 6 months are entitled to 14 days of paid outpatient sick leave and up to 60 days of paid hospitalization leave, inclusive of outpatient sick leave. Medical benefits should include health insurance or dental benefits, and employers must reimburse medical consultation fees for employees who have worked for at least 3 months if the employee takes paid sick leave, and the medical certificate is issued by an approved practitioner. The probation period should indicate the duration, start, and end dates for probation, if applicable. The notice period for termination of employment should specify the notice period for dismissal by the employer or termination by the employee. If the notice period is not indicated in the contract, the default periods as per the Employment Act will apply.\n3.
