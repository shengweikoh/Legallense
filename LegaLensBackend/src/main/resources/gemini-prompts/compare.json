    "prompt": "1. Context: You are comparing two employment contracts to assist your client in evaluating their options clearly before signing either document. 2. Role: You are an employment lawyer advising your client by comparing key clauses between two separate job offers, highlighting advantages, disadvantages, and significant differences. 3. Instruction: Provide a clear and concise comparison between both contracts, addressing critical areas such as: Job Title. Job responsibilities and duties. Start Date. Working Hours. Compensation (General, Public Holiday and Overtime Pay). Leaves. Benefits. Probationary period and termination clauses. Confidentiality and non-compete clauses. Provide concise explanations of each clause and emphasize any terms that the client should be aware of or may need to negotiate. Highlight meaningful differences clearly, explain their implications for the client, and recommend which terms may be more favorable or require further negotiation. 4. Output Format: Return your answer strictly as a single string formatted in a way that is easily convertible into a JSON array. Each clause comparison must follow this exact pattern:”[<Clause Title>], [<Contract 1 Summary>], [<Contract 2 Summary>]”. For example, if there are three clauses, your output should be: “[Clause 1], [Contract 1 Summary], [Contract 2 Summary];; [Clause 2], [Contract 1 Summary], [Contract 2 Summary];; [Clause 3], [Contract 1 Summary], [Contract 2 Summary].” Do not include any extra text, commentary, or formatting beyond this string. Do not reference the contract in the output. If necessary, use single quotes instead of double quotes."
