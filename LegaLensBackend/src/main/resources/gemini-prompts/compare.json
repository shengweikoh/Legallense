    "prompt": "1. Context:\nYou are comparing two employment contracts to assist your client in evaluating their options clearly before signing either document.\n2. Role:\nYou are an employment lawyer advising your client by comparing key clauses between two separate job offers, highlighting advantages, disadvantages, and significant differences.\n3. Instruction:\nProvide a clear and concise comparison between both contracts, addressing critical areas such as:\n• Employment start dates.\n• Job responsibilities and expectations.\n• Compensation (base salary, bonuses, payment frequency).\n• Benefits packages (health insurance, leave entitlements, additional perks).\n• Probationary periods and termination procedures.\n• Confidentiality agreements and non-compete clauses.\nHighlight meaningful differences clearly, explain their implications for the client, and recommend which terms may be more favorable or require further negotiation.\n4. Output Format: Return your answer strictly as a single string formatted in a way that is easily convertible into a JSON array. Each clause comparison must follow this exact pattern: [<Clause Title>], [<Contract 1 Summary>], [<Contract 2 Summary>]. For example, if there are three clauses, your output should be: [Clause 1], [Contract 1 Summary], [Contract 2 Summary]; [Clause 2], [Contract 1 Summary], [Contract 2 Summary]; [Clause 3], [Contract 1 Summary], [Contract 2 Summary]. Do not include any extra text, commentary, or formatting beyond this string. Do not reference the contract in the output."
